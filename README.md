# RestComm Media-Core

The RestComm Media-Core is a Java-based core framework where Media Services can be built on top of.
This project includes the core runtime that is used by the [RestComm Media Server application](https://github.com/RestComm/media-server-standalone).

Thanks to its pluggable architecture, users are able to develop and assemble a set of plugins for different features (such as ASR, VAD, Codecs, etc) according to their needs.
This allows users to build tailored versions of a Media Service best suited for their needs.
